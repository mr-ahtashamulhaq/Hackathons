## 🎯 Project Overview  
AI Wellness Companion is an intelligent agent-powered wellness assistant designed to help users track mood, receive personalized mental health guidance, and maintain emotional well-being through conversational support and insights. It’s built in the spirit of the Internet of Agents challenge — combining autonomous agent logic, AI reasoning, and user interaction.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
- Mental health is often neglected due to lack of immediate, personalized support.  
- Users need an approachable companion to log feelings, reflect, and get guidance without always relying on professionals.  
- Traditional chatbots lack emotional continuity, memory, and proactive engagement.

---

## 💡 Solution  
- A conversational AI agent that models empathy, remembers user mood patterns, and proactively prompts reflection.  
- Uses context and historical data to provide adaptive suggestions (breathing exercises, journaling prompts, mood-boosting suggestions).  
- Designed to act like a “companion” agent, not just a static question/answer bot.
